# Database Migrations

This directory will contain Alembic migration scripts for database schema changes.

## Structure

Each migration script will be automatically generated by Alembic and will contain:
- An upgrade() function to apply the migration
- A downgrade() function to reverse the migration
- A revision identifier and dependencies

## Usage

Future: Alembic will be integrated to handle database migrations. For now, the schema is managed by init_db.py.
